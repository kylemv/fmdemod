# fmdemod
FM Modulator and Demodulator for use in redhawk using liquid-dsp library.  

Much of this code was auto generated by Redhawk using properties I specified in the xml files. I wrote the myFMDemodulator.cpp, myFMModulator.cpp, and similarly named .h files.

To use these components

1) Install redhawk:

  -http://redhawksdr.github.io/Documentation/mainch2.html#x4-60002

2) Install liquid-dsp

	-Clone the repository at lmcadoo2/liquid-dsp

	  git clone git://github.com/lmcadoo2/liquid-dsp.git

	-Enter the directory

	-Run the following
	
		./bootstrap.sh
	 	./configure
	 	make
  	sudo make install

3) Get the component code

	-Clone this repository

	 git clone git://github.com/kylemv/fmdemod.git

	-Import the project into eclipse

  	-File->Import->C/C++->Existing Code as Makefile Project

  	-Browse to the folder in the 'Existing Code Location' box

  	-Finish

	-Build the project

  	-Right click the project folder and select 'Build Project'

	-Export to the 'Target SDR'

  	-Drag the project folder to 'Target SDR' in the SCA Explorer view

4) The component is now ready for use in Redhawk. For more information on components in Redhawk, see chapters 3 and 4 in the documentation located here:
